    <h2>Why "Dynamic Programming"?</h2>

    <blockquote style="width:90%; margin-top: 2em; font-size:0.7em">
        The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We
        had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named Wilson. He was
        Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and
        hatred of the word research. I’m not using the term lightly; I’m using
        it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would
        get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You can
        imagine how he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND
        Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson
        as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield
        Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing
        mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I
        choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision
        making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various
        reasons. I decided therefore to use the word “programming”. I wanted to
        get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this
        was time-varying. I thought, let's kill two birds with one stone. Let's
        take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in
        the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property
        as an adjective, and that it's impossible to use the word dynamic in a
        pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly
        give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic
        programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman
        could object to.
