    <h2>Computational Models</h2>

<div style="float:left; margin-top:3%; width:40%">
    <ul class="spaced" style="margin-left:5%">
	<li> Computational models are often designed to be comparable to a <i>target</i> real-world phenomenon.</li>
	<li> Through an iterative process the model can be improved upon 
	until it can predict what the real world system will do in various circumstances.</li>
	<li> A trade off is common between being simple, realistic and predictive. 
	<i>What is the minimal model that is maximally predictive</i>?</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Complex Systems</h2>
	
<div style="float:left; margin-top:1%; width:40%">
<p>Many systems of interest are <b>extremely complex</b>, involving many components, involved in complex forms of feedback, etc.</p>
<p>And this leads to some serious challenges!</p>

    <ol>
	<li> Prohibitive computational complexity</li>
	<li> Free parameters -- <i>How do we assign values to unknowns</i>?</li>
	<li> When models become too big, they become almost as hard to understand as their target!</li>
	</ol>

<p>Lots of work to be done here, and progress continues to be made. </p>

	<h2>An alternative approach...</h2>
	
<div style="float:left; margin-top:3%; width:40%">
    <ul class="spaced" style="margin-left:5%">
	<li> An alternative approach is to create <b>artificial systems</b> 
	that capture some interesting life-like property, and to study that.</li>
	<li> Artificial systems can be designed to be more simple than their real-world target.</li>
	<li> This was the approach of cyberneticists such as Grey Walter in the mid-20th century.</li>
	<li> And artificial life can be thought of as an extension of this way of working.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Targets</h2>
	
<div style="float:left; margin-top:3%; width:40%">
    <ul class="spaced" style="margin-left:5%">
	<li> Precise equivalence between the artificial system and a target real-world system is not always the primary goal.</li>
	<li> Sometimes, the goal is to investigate a hypothesis or the implications of a theory ...</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Passive Dynamic Walkers</h2>
	
<div style="float:left; margin-top:1%; width:40%">
<p>Hypothesis: "Effective motion is not purely the performance of a computer-like brain, 
but is enabled by the physical properties of the body and how it interacts with the world."</p>
<p><b>How much can a brainless body do?</b></p>

    <ul>
	<li> No computer / "brain"</li>
	<li> No sensors</li>
	<li> No motors!</li>
	<li> Just a very deliberately designed shape.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Compared to humans, very simple and easy to study. </p>
