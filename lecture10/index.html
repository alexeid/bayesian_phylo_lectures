	<ul class="spaced" style="margin-top:5%; width:85%">
	<li>is a model of the ancestral relationships of a sample of individuals taken from a larger population.
	<li>describes a probability distribution on ancestral genealogies (trees) given a population history, N(t).
	<li>Therefore the coalescent can convert information from ancestral genealogies into information about population history and vice versa.
	<li>a model of ancestral genealogies, not sequences, and its simplest form assumes neutral evolution.
	<li>can be thought of as a prior on the tree, in a Bayesian setting.
