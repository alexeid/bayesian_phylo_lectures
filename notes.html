* Three guest lectures will not be examined
* Explain how gamma distribution can be incorporated into Felsenstein's phylogenetic likelihood
* Show an animation of sampling tree space.
* Remove differential description of substitution models
* Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) 
   1. slide 2/7; Don't need to know the differential form - not examinable
   2. Slide 2/20; Don't need to know the JC distance correction with site rate heterogeneity
* Bayesian phylogenetics
   1. slide 10; Don't need to be able to reproduce the stochastic trajectory formalism at the top of this slide; 
   do need to know that the acceptance probability fulfils the requirement achieving the target distribution as the equilibrium.
   
* Assignment
  1. You may need to calculation the posterior probability in log space. So a product of probabilities becomes a sum of log probabilities.
  2. The acceptance probability ratio becomes a = min(1, exp(logP(x')-logP(x)))
