    <h2>Tree space</h2>

    <img data-src="fig_1_treesubspace.svg" style="width:52%">
    
    <ul>
    <li>A two-dimensional space representing all
possible time-trees for the topology ((1,2),3). 
<li>x and y, are the two inter-coalescent intervals($t_{root} = x + y$). 
<li>Three trees are displayed, with their arithmetic mean tree. 
<li>Dashed lines show the shortest distances to mean (i.e. deviations from the mean).

</ul>

    <h2>Tree space</h2>
    
    <img data-src="fig_2_treespace.svg" style="width:55%">


<ul>
<li>The simplest non-trivial tree space for time-trees ($n=3$)
<li> Each non-degenerate tree topology is a two-dimensional space.
<li> These subspaces meet at a shared edge representing the star
tree, which is a one-dimensional subspace (parameter is the age of the root)
<li> Dashed lines are shortest distances between the four displayed trees.
</ul>

<h2>Projection of tree space on 4 taxa</h2>

    <img data-src="tauSpace.svg" style="height:80%">

<p>This is a projection of a part of 4-taxa tree space. The full number of subspaces is actually 18, but we only show 6  of them here. Also each subspace is actually a cube, but we show them as squares by fixing the tip-most interval.</p>

<p> The "substitution tree" is in units of expected substitutions, i.e. genetic distances.</p>
