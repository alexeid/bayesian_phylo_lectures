    <h2>Tree space</h2>

    <img data-src="fig_1_treesubspace.svg" style="width:52%">
    
    <ul>
    <li>A two-dimensional space representing all
possible time-trees for the topology ((1,2),3). 
<li>x and y, are the two inter-coalescent intervals($t_{root} = x + y$). 
<li>Three trees are displayed, with their arithmetic mean tree. 
<li>Dashed lines show the shortest distances to mean (i.e. deviations from the mean).

</ul>

    <h2>Tree space</h2>
    
    <img data-src="fig_2_treespace.svg" style="width:55%">


<ul>
<li>The simplest non-trivial tree space for time-trees ($n=3$)
<li> Each non-degenerate tree topology is a two-dimensional space.
<li> These subspaces meet at a shared edge representing the star
tree, which is a one-dimensional subspace (parameter is the age of the root)
<li> Dashed lines are shortest distances between the four displayed trees.
</ul>

<h2>Projection of tree space on 4 taxa</h2>

    <img data-src="tauSpace.svg" style="height:80%">

<p>This is a projection of a part of 4-taxa tree space. The full number of subspaces is actually 18, but we only show 6  of them here. Also each subspace is actually a cube, but we show them as squares by fixing the tip-most interval.</p>

<h2>Genetic distance = rate $\times$ time</h2>

<p> The strict molecular clock parameterization </p>

    <img data-src="fig_StrictClockParam.svg" style="width:90%">

<p> The "substitution tree" is in units of expected substitutions, i.e. genetic distances.</p>

<h2>Identifiability via node calibrations</h2>

  <p>Suppose fossil evidence shows the common ancestor of species A, B and C lived 25-35 Mya.</p>

    <img data-src="fig_NodeCalibration.png" style="width:85%">

  <p>With a strict molecular clock, only the age (range) of a single node in the tree is needed in order to
  interpolate and extrapolate the ages of all other divergence times. 
  <p>Once a known node age like this "calibrates" the tree, the
  genetic distances can be separated into an absolute rate and divergence times.</p>

<h2>Identifiability via leaf calibrations</h2>

  <p>Suppose sample C is ancient DNA from subfossil remains dated to 20 thousand years ago.</p>

    <img data-src="fig_LeafCalibration.png" style="width:85%">

  <p>With a strict molecular clock, calibration is possible with data from non-contemporaneous taxa (e.g. ancient DNA, or samples from different years in a rapidly evolving virus). 
  <p>Again, once one or more non-contemporaneous leaf nodes like this "calibrate" the time scale of the tree, the
  genetic distances can be separated into an absolute rate and divergence times.</p>
