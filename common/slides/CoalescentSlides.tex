Data: a \alert{small genetic sample} from a \alert{large background population}.

\alert{The coalescent }
\begin{itemize}
\item is a model of the ancestral relationships of a sample of individuals taken from a larger population.
\smallskip
\item describes a probability distribution on ancestral genealogies (trees) given a population history, $N(t)$. 
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Therefore the coalescent can convert information from ancestral genealogies into information about population history and vice versa.
  \end{itemize}
\smallskip
\item a model of ancestral genealogies, not sequences, and its simplest form assumes neutral evolution.
\smallskip
\item can be thought of as a prior on the tree, in a Bayesian setting.

Most of theoretical population genetics is based on the idealized
Wright-Fisher model of population which assumes

\begin{itemize}
\item Constant population size $N$
\item Discrete generations
\item Complete mixing
\end{itemize}
For the purposes of this presentation the population will be assumed to be haploid,
as is the case for many pathogens.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item The probability of fixation of a novel, neutral mutation is $\frac{1}{N}$
%\item The average time to this fixation is approximately $2N$ generations
%\item Again, assuming neutral mutations, the average number of mutations between
%a random pair of individuals from the same generation is 
%\end{itemize}
%\begin{equation}

%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item Another way of saying this is that the average number of mutations
%%back to the common ancestor of two random individuals is $N\mu$.

  \frametitle{Kingman's n-coalescent}

\begin{columns}

\column{.64\textwidth}

Consider tracing the ancestry of a sample of $k$ individuals from the present,
back into the past.

This process is a discrete-time Markov process that eventually \emph{coalesces} to a
single common ancestor (\emph{concestor}) of the sample of individuals. 

Kingman's n-coalescent is a \emph{continuous-time}  diffusion approximation of this process, in the limit
of large $N$, i.e. $N \gg k^2$.

\frametitle{The coalescence of two ancestral lineages}

\begin{columns}

\column{.64\textwidth}

\begin{itemize}
\item First, consider two random members from a population of fixed size $N$. 

\item By perfect mixing, the probability they share a \emph{concestor} in the previous generation is $1/N$. 

\item The probability the concestor is $t$ generations back is 

\begin{equation*}
Pr\{t\} = \frac{1}{N}(1-\frac{1}{N})^{t-1}. 
\end{equation*}

\item It follows that $g=t-1$, has a geometric distribution with a success rate of $\lambda =
1/N$, and so has mean $N$ and variance of $N^3/(N-1)$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The coalescence of $k$ lineages}

\begin{columns}

\column{.64\textwidth}

With $k$ lineages the time to the first coalescence is derived in the same way,
only now there are $\binom{k}{2}$ possible pairs that may coalesce, resulting in
a success rate of $\lambda = \binom{k}{2}/N$ and mean time to first coalescence ($t_k$) of

\begin{equation*}
E[t_k] = \frac{N}{\binom{k}{2}}.
\end{equation*}

This implicitly assumes that $N$ is much larger than $O(k^2)$, so that the probability
of two coalescent events in the same generation is small.

\end{frame}


%\begin{frame}
%\frametitle{Some classical coalescent results}

%An interesting consequence is that the average number of generations required for all $k$ lineages to
%coalesce into one is 

%\begin{equation}
%E[t_{root}] = \sum_{i=2}^k \frac{N}{\binom{i}{2}} = 2N(1-\frac{1}{k}), 
%\end{equation}

%which approaches $2N$ as $k$ increases.

\frametitle{The coalescent is a \emph{diffusion approximation}}

Kingman (1982) showed that as $N$ grows the coalescent process converges to a
continuous-time Markov chain.

\medskip
\begin{columns}[t]

\column{0.5\textwidth}

$\lambda = \binom{k}{2}/N$ is the rate of coalescence, i.e. the probability of coalescing a pair from $k$ lineages on a short time
interval $\Delta t$ is $O({\lambda\Delta t})$. Unsurprisingly the solution turns
out to be the exponential distribution:

\begin{equation*}
f(t_k)=\frac{{k \choose 2}}{N}\exp\left(-\frac{{k \choose 2}t_k}{N}\right)\,.

\frametitle{The coalescent density for a genealogy}

For a genealogy with coalescent times $\mathbf{t}=\{t_2, t_3, ..., t_n\}$ we can write the probability density, given $N$:

\begin{equation*}
f(\mathbf{t}|N)=\frac{1}{N^{n-1}}\prod_{k=2}^n\exp\left(-\frac{{k \choose 2}t_k}{N}\right)\,.
\end{equation*}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The coalescent density with varying population size}

The generalization of the coalescent for the case where the
population size changes over time, $N = N(t)$ is given by Griffiths and Tavare (1994). They showed that the coalescent density for the first coalescence event being at time $t$ in the past given $n$ lineages is:

\begin{equation*}
f(t) = {\frac{1}{N(t)}}  
{\exp\left(-{\int \limits_0^t \frac{\binom{n}{2}}{N(x)} dx }\right)} 
\label{coalescent-density-with-nt}
\end{equation*}

\frametitle{The coalescent with serial samples}

Many epidemiological agents, like RNA viruses, evolve very rapidly, so that the effect of sampling the population at different times becomes important.

How similar are these two trees? Both of them are plausible given the data.
We can use Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo to average the coalescent over all plausible trees.
